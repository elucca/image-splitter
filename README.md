# image-splitter
Splits images into constituent channels

## Usage
Run the program as a module with `python -m random_genome --input_paths <paths separated by spaces> --output_paths <paths separated by spaces>` from the project root folder.

Multiple folder paths may be given. Input and output paths must match, e.g. images in the third input folder are decomposed into the third output folder.
